# DataWorkbench

### Introduction
This project is made for python programmers work with sql database.
Python programmers can use python to query and clean their data by the help of sql.
For example, programmers can scrape some data with the python script box, 
and use purely python code to create a database table to store the result. They can either import their csv files or build their dataset from scratch with python. After they finished editing the data, they could export the data as csv file. (more info can be refered from manual test plan and proposal)
### Usage
